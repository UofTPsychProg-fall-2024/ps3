# pandorable
problem set 3 

In this problem set, you'll practice your new pandas data management skills, 
continuing to work with the 2018 IAT data used in class. You can use the included
codebook to double check any of the variable codes as needed.

Note that this is a group assignment. You will be assigned to a group of ~4 students. You can divvy
up the questions between you, or better yet, work together on the questions to 
overcome potential hurdles.
